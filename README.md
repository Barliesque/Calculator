# Calculator
A small C# project that processes mathematical expressions in string format.  Operations that may be performed:

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Modulus
- Numeric comparisons resulting in a boolean value
- Boolean comparisons:  and, or, ==, !=
- Ceil(), Floor(), Round()
- Abs()
- Pow()
...as well as external function calls with an arbitrary number of parameters.

Partially implemented:
- Ternary operators...  bool ? ifTrue : ifFalse
